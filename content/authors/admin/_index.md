I just finised my PhD program at center for [intelligent maintenance systems (IMS)](http://www.imscenter.net/), [University of Cincinnati](https://www.uc.edu/).

I work under the supervision of Prof. [Jay Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g9GtqgQAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I am looking for a full-time job on industrial AI, predictive analytics related areas.
